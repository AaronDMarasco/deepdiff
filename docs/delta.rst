Delta
=====

Delta objects are like git commits but for structured data.
You can convert the diff results into Delta objects, store the deltas and later apply to other objects.

.. note::
    If you plan to generate Delta objects from the DeepDiff result, and ignore_order=True, you need to also set the report_repetition=True.
